## Too Many Cooks
- Register on TMC immediately
- Don't edit files that are locked; lock files when editing
- COMMUNICATE REGULARLY AND COORDINATE WITH OTHERS THROUGH MESSAGES

# Rules

- ZERO DUPLICATION
- E2E Tests only. No unit tests
- 100% test coverage
- Turn lintz up to errors. Turn all lintz on
- No files larger than 400 LOC
- Functions less than 30 LOC

## Rust

## Dart
- You must use the austerity package for linting and the nadz package for Result<T,E>.
- Use Material Design for the theme!!!
